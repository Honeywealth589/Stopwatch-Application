Stopwatch Project README
Introduction
This project is a simple stopwatch application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The stopwatch allows users to start, stop, and reset a timer, displaying the elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

Technologies Used
HTML: Used for structuring the content and layout of the stopwatch application.
CSS: Used for styling and layout of the application.
JavaScript: Used for implementing the stopwatch functionality, including starting, stopping, and resetting the timer.
How to Use
Open the index.html file in a web browser to access the stopwatch application.
Click the "Start" button to begin the timer.
Click the "Stop" button to pause the timer.
Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer to 0.
Implementation Details
HTML Structure
The HTML structure consists of a simple layout with a header, timer display, and button controls. The timer display is updated dynamically using JavaScript.

CSS Styling
The CSS styles are used to layout the application and provide a visually appealing design. The styles are applied to the HTML elements using class selectors.

JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code is responsible for implementing the stopwatch functionality. The code uses the following functions:

start(): Starts the timer and updates the timer display every 10 milliseconds.
stop(): Pauses the timer and stops updating the timer display.
reset(): Resets the timer to 0 and updates the timer display.

Challenges Faced
During the development of this project, I faced the following challenges:

Synchronizing the timer display: Ensuring that the timer display updated accurately and in real-time was a challenge. I had to use the setInterval function to update the timer display every 10 milliseconds, and also handle the case where the user stops and starts the timer multiple times.
Handling timer reset: Resetting the timer to 0 and updating the timer display was another challenge. I had to ensure that the timer display was updated correctly when the user clicks the "Reset" button.
Debugging JavaScript code: Debugging the JavaScript code was a challenge, especially when dealing with timer-related issues. I had to use the browser's developer tools to debug the code and identify the issues.
